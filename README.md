FeatureExtraction is part of the [OHDSI Methods Library](https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary).

Introduction
============
An R package for generating features (covariates) for a cohort using data in the Common Data Model.

Features
========
- Takes a cohort as input.
- Generates baseline features for that cohort.
- Default covariates include all drugs, diagnoses, procedures, as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc.
- Support for creating custom covariates.
- Generate paper-ready summary table of select population characteristics.

Technology
==========
FeatureExtraction is an R package, with some functions implemented in C++.

System Requirements
===================
Requires R (version 3.2.2 or higher). Installation on Windows requires [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). FeatureExtraction require Java.

Getting Started
===============
1. On Windows, make sure [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed.
2. FeatureExtraction as well as the DatabaseConnector and SqlRender packages require Java. Java can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">http://www.java.com</a>.
3. In R, use the following commands to download and install FeatureExtraction:

  ```r
  install.packages("drat")
  drat::addRepo("OHDSI")
  install.packages("FeatureExtraction")
  ```
